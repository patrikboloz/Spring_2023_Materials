"""Midterm:
Create these Python functions and/or classes. Each function/class that is
correctly created and tested is worth 50 points.

1) Create a function called list_square that given a list of numbers will 
turn every item of a list into its square.
For example: a_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6] will be output_list = [1,4,9,16,25,36]
HINT: Use a for loop to iterate through the list.

2) Create a function called list_item_erase, that by taking the user's input
will create a list of user numbers. Then the function will ask the user for
a number, which will be deleted with ALL its occurences from the list. Print 
out how many numbers have been deleted from the list. 

3) Create a class called Calculator, that will have two arguments in
__init__() called: num1, num2. Then create two attributes self.num1 and
self.num2 that will be used throughout the Calculator class. Create 4
methods called class_sum, class_div, class_add, class_mult to do summation,
division, addition, and multiplication, respectively. Then test it out
on the two numbers.
