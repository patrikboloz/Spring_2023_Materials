Create one file CarLab.cpp, where by using 3 different 
namespaces, you will create 3 different Car constructs.
The three namespaces will be named electric, hybrid, and
gasoline. 

Each car struct will have a string name, an int top speed,
and and int acceleration. Create one constructor that will
only take a string name, when creating an object with the
contrust's name.
You will then create a main function, where you will create
3 car objects and by the use of an overloaded cout, output 
all 3 car's information (name, top speed, acceleration) into
the terminal.

HINT: Create an overloaded operator<< function in each of the
namespace to overload the << function.

EXTRA CREDIT:
Do this code without the use of "using namespace std;"

Due by the end of lab.
