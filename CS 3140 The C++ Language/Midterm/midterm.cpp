/* Midterm assignment
Complete these 5 assignments. Each assignment is worth 30 points.
Create and submit only ONE .cpp file (you can omit the executable
if Brightspace will give you any issues)

For this assignment, create these 5 functions and run them all in
the main():

1) Write a function that will check if a user's given positive number 
is a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 7. (output will be either 1/true 
or 0/false)
2) Write a function that will check the largest number among four given
doubles.
3) Write a function that will reverse a given string.
4) By using a for loop and conditions (if-else, switch, ?) create 
a function that will take in a user's input and will check if the
user's chosen number is a prime number
5) Write a function that will find the largest word in a given user's
string

Make sure to create a main() function where you will use all of your
functions.
