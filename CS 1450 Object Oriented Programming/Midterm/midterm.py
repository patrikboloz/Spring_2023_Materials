""" Midterm

Create these three classes and either have them all in one file or
you can have seperate files for all classes. (it's your choice)
Each successfully created and tested class will be worth 50 points.

1) Create a class called Mood. This class will start with an attribute
called self.computer_mood = "Neutral". Then create these 4 methods called 
angry, sad, happy, and neutral, which will change self.computer_mood to 
their respective moods and will print out a message, how the computer feels, 
when those methods are called/used. Test the class by creating an object from 
the class and use all methods to change the computer's mood.

2) Create a class called Calculator, that will have two arguments in
__init__() called: num1, num2. Then create two attributes self.num1 and
self.num2 that will be used throughout the Calculator class. Create 4
methods called class_sum, class_div, class_add, class_mult to do summation,
division, addition, and multiplication, respectively. Then test it out
on the two numbers, that will be chosen by using the user's input.

3) Create a class called School_Class, that starts with an attribute called 
self.class_list, which will start as an empty list. Create three methods 
called add_student, delete_student, change_student. Create an interactive 
menu, where a user will be able use those three methods to add a student
to the list, delete a student from the list, and change the student's name.
(take a look at our earlier examples of an interactive menu with Bank and 
Account classes). Then test it out on your interactive menu.
