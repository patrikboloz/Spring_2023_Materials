This lab will use your skills of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.
Create 1 Car class and 3 child classes that inherit from the parent Car class
called Gasoline, Hybrid, and Electric. The parent class will start like this:

class Car():
    def __init__(self, carType="Base Frame"):
        if not carType == "Base Frame":
            self.carType = None
        else:
        	self.carType = "Base Frame"
        self.currentSpeed = 0

    def accelarate(self, speedValue):
    	print("Needs to be overwritten.")

    def break(self, breakValue):
    	print("Needs to be overwritten.")

    def getCurrentSpeed(self):
    	return self.currentSpeed

Your 3 children classes will inherit from Car and will overwrite accelerate and break
methods to your liking. Then create 5 child objects, accelerate and break at least once,
and print out the current speed. 

Due by the next lab.
