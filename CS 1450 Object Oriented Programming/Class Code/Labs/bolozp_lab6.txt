Lab 6

Create a Python animation using two classes called Sun and Moon.
Both of these objects will start in the opposite locations of each
other with a constant distance between each other. With a circular 
motion they will move around a center of the window in a constant
speed.

Extra credit:
When the Sun object is on the top side of the screen, a "day" music
will play and when the moon is on the top side of the screen, a "night"
music will play.

Hint: To learn more about how to implement a circular motion, research
it online. A Youtube video about this matter can be found here:
