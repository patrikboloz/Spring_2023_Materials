"""CS 1450 - Lab 5
Create a simple game, where you will have some kind of object
constantly moving on the bottom of the screen on the x-axis 
from left to right and change direction. This object will then 
"shoot" a projectile at another object (target) at the top of 
the screen whenever the user presses the SPACEBAR and when the 
projectile hits the rectangle/hitbox of the top object, the game 
ends.

Requirements:
Only use procedural programming (no custom user-created OOP methods)
1) Have 3 different pictures for the three objects: the bottom,
the projectile, and the target. Use "rect" to create rectangles/hit boxes 
2) Have 3 different sounds: 
   2.1) sound that's played when the bottom object shoots
   2.2) sound that's played when the projectile "hits" the target
   2.3) background sound that's played throughout the whole game
3) Whenever the user presses SPACEBAR, only then the projectile "shoots" 
at the target.

EXTRA CREDIT:
4) Change the target's location randomly each time the game is played
5) Play a "win" sound, when gets played, when the target is hit
succesfully.

Due by next lab.
