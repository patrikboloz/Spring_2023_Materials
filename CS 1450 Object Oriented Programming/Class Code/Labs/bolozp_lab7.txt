This lab will use your skills of encapsulation and polymorphism.
Create 3 car classes in 3 different files called Gasoline, Hybrid, and Electric.

Each class will also start with an initial method where you will start with 0 speed,
and different top speed.
By the use of polymorphism, each class will have the same methods called:
	1) accelarate
	2) break
	3) getCurrentSpeed
You will choose how the speed will change based on the different car.

Then create a main.py file where you will import all 3 classes and by the use of
a for loop and a car list, create 5 different car objects and call the methods.
Each car should accelerate at least twice, break at least once, and print out the 
current speed to the terminal at least once.

Due by next lab.
